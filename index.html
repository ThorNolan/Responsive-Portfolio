            <p>Hi there! My name is Thor Nolan, and I am an aspiring web developer living in the Bay Area, currently enrolled in UC Berkeley Extension's coding bootcamp. I am always looking for new ways to expand my coding skill set and gain new hands-on experience working with code.</p> 
            
            <p>My areas of interest include technology, philosophy, politics, writing, and gaming, but that's only to name a few. By the time I finish my bootcamp, I will be at least somewhat versed in HTML, CSS and CSS frameworks, vanilla Javascript, jQuery, and React, Git, Github, and Heroku, Django, MySQL and MongoDB, as well as Express and the MERN Stack.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not working on honing my coding skills, I enjoy rock climbing at my local climbing gym, or getting outside to climb or hike whenever I can. I am also an avid PC gamer, and have enjoyed building and updating the parts of my own PC for gaming as well as adding to my unreasonably large (and still-growing) library of games.</p>
