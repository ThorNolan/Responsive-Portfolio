Responsive Portfolio
=======================
For this excercise I built off of my existing portfolio page and added some responsiveness using CSS so that the content of the page will adjust based on the viewport.  

## Technologies used
This page is made using HTML and CSS, more specifically it relies on CSS media queries to change elements based on the size of the viewport.
